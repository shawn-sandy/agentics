# Changelog — git-agent

## v1.2.0 — Add new-branch skill

- New skill: `new-branch` — fetches latest from `origin` and creates a branch from `origin/<default>` without switching to the default branch first
- Prompts for name (or extracts from user message) and type prefix, with a recommendation based on observed branch naming patterns in the repo
- Interactive confirmation when working tree is dirty; carries uncommitted changes forward when git allows it

## v1.1.0 — Add ship skill

- New skill: `ship` — chains commit + push + PR into a single flow
- Unified pre-flight checks before any mutations
- Pushes to existing PR if one already exists on the branch

## v1.0.0 — Initial release with commit-agent and pr-agent skills
